# Qr-CodeGenerator
This is a simple Python application for generating QR codes from a user-provided link. The app is built using the tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface and the qrcode library for generating QR codes.

# Install
To run the app, simply execute the "Qr-CodeGenerator by-MauroPepa.py" file. Once the app is launched, enter a link into the input field and click the "GENERATE QR" button. The generated QR code will be displayed in the center of the window.

To change the appearance of the app, the "customtkinter" library has been used. The appearance of the app can be modified by changing the color theme and appearance mode in the code.

Note: The app saves the generated QR code as a PNG image in the same directory as the Python script.

tkinter
customtkinter
